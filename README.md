React JS app that uses google's book api to find books based on a search term, which can be an author, title or key word. 

The search return a maxiumum of 12 results which are shown in a grid. When a grid section is clicked, it opens a model with further information about that book. 

Modal set up with the use of 'useState'.

NO backend set up needed as drawing from external API. 

Linking straight to image through api ket crashing app, so used the id for each book to insert into the images url.
